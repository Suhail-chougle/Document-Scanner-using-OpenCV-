Project Title: Document Scanner using OpenCV: Transform Images into Scanned Documents

Introduction:
Welcome to our Document Scanner project using OpenCV! This project is designed to transform regular images into scanned documents using a series of image processing techniques. By leveraging OpenCV, we achieve noise reduction, edge detection, contour analysis, and perspective transformation to create a realistic scanned effect.

Step 1: Image Preprocessing
We begin by importing the image and converting it into grayscale, preparing it for further processing.

Step 2: Noise Reduction
Using Gaussian blur with a 5x5 kernel, we effectively remove noise, enhancing the image quality.

Step 3: Edge Detection
We employ Canny edge detection to identify edges in the image, which is crucial for contour detection.

Step 4: Contour Analysis
All contours in the image are extracted, and the contour with the maximum area is selected as the document's outline.

Step 5: Perspective Transform
Drawing the detected contour on the original image, we create a mask consisting of that contour only. We then detect the corners from this mask.

Step 6: Scanned Effect
With perspective transform applied to the image, we achieve the desired scanned effect using thresholding.

Integration and Output:
The project seamlessly integrates all steps to transform regular images into realistic scanned documents. The output presents a high-quality scanned version of the original image.

Conclusion:
The Document Scanner project using OpenCV offers a powerful tool to convert images into scanned documents with exceptional clarity and accuracy.
